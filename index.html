				AMERICA
			</h2>
			<p> National parks are among Canada's - and the world's - natural jewels. They represent the power of Canada's natural environment — a compelling force — which has shaped not only the geography of this country, but also the course of its history and the experiences of the people who live and travel here.
				National parks are established to protect and present outstanding representative examples of natural landscapes and natural
				phenomena that occur in Canada's 39 natural regions, as identified in the National Parks System Plan.
